# House_Price_Prediction


# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model that predicts house prices using linear regression. The dataset used is the Boston Housing Dataset, which contains information about houses in Boston and their prices.

## Features Used
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Model
- **Linear Regression**: A simple, interpretable model for regression tasks.

## Steps:
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Visualize the relationship between the number of rooms and house prices.
3. Split the data into training and test sets.
4. Train the model on the training data.
5. Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

## Evaluation:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **R-Squared**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that's predictable from the independent variable.

## Running the Project
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells.
